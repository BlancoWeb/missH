          Originally from Northern Ireland, I went to Edinburgh University to study Primary Education. After my degree, I continued to live in the city and taught in many Primary schools across East Lothian and Edinburgh. I have had over 11 years’ experience of teaching mainstream primary, as well as experience of teaching specialist subjects such as Music and PE.

            Along the way, I have developed my passion and enthusiasm for making learning interactive and providing lessons to suit all learners.  
            I have always supported fellow colleagues with any queries or teaching ideas that they have e.g. thinking of an activity to support with writing or  Cross-curricular topic. I can think fast on my feet and always provided out-of-the-box activities that they could use.<br /> I have experience with teaching online and feel confident in this learning style, providing fun and engaging lessons to pupils, helping them to grasp a concept or discover new learning.<br/><br/>Recently I have moved to Ireland, due to the impact of Covid-19 and wanted to be available to support family through these challenging times. I am still continuing to teach in schools, but wanted to set up my own website to share my ideas, activities and resources that have worked successful for me in the past for engaging and motivating pupils’ learning.<br/><br/>
          
          Resources that have been created to provide support with home learning, have been carefully thought out, providing some independent activities that can be done without parental support as well as activities that can be enjoyed by the whole family.<br/><br/>
          
          I hope you find the resources that I have created helpful and useful.<br/><br/>
          
          All the best.<br/>
          Miss H.
