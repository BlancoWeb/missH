        <p class="about__par">
            Originally from Northern Ireland, I went to Edinburgh University to study, Primary Education. After my degree, I continued to live in the city and taught in many Primary schools across East Lothian and Edinburgh. I have had over 11 years’ experience of teaching mainstream primary, as well as experience of teaching specialist subjects such as Music and PE. I have also provided many After school Club lessons such as Guitar, Drumming, Tennis and Football clubs. <br/><br/>
            
            Along the way, I have developed my passion and enthusiasm for making learning interactive and providing lessons to suit all learners. I work well in a team and have always supported fellow colleagues with any queries or teaching ideas that they have e.g. thinking of an activity to support with writing or a Cross-curricular topic. I can think fast on my feet and always provided out-of-the-box activities that they could use.<br/><br/>
            
            I am confident with teaching online and providing fun, engaging lessons to pupils, helping them to grasp a concept, revise new learning, encouraging them to share activities and how they feel confidently as well as providing team quizzes and home problem-solving challenges. <br/><br/>
            
            Recently I have moved to Ireland, due to the impact of Covid-19 and wanting to be available to support family and friends through these challenging times. 
            
            Teachers and schools have been working extremely hard in these times, to make sure learning provided is still the best it can be, as well as maintaining safe protocols around the school and in the classroom. Obviously when schools are affected and close, I can understand how frustrating, worried and anxious parents are in making sure their child is still getting a good quality education by being available to support learning online or having to provide learning activities in the home. <br/><br/>
            
            That’s when I decided, I wanted to set up my own website to share my ideas, activities and resources that have worked successful for me in the past for engaging and motivating pupils’ learning as well as offering up my time to support pupils through one-to-one lessons during these challenging times. <br/><br/>
            
            Resources that have been created to provide support with home learning, have been carefully thought out, providing some independent activities that can be done without parental support as well as activities that can be enjoyed by the whole family. <br/><br/>
            
            I hope you find the resources that I have created helpful and useful.<br/><br/>
            
            All the best.
